# Specification Update Rule

## Rule
When making changes to this project, you MUST update the `spec.md` file to reflect:

1. **Implementation Status** — Update the checkbox status (⬜ → ✅) when a section/component is completed
2. **New Components** — Add any new components to the Components List
3. **Design Changes** — Document any deviations from the original Figma design
4. **New Assets** — Add any new images/icons to the Assets Required section
5. **Notes & Decisions** — Document important implementation decisions

## When to Update
- After completing a section or component
- When adding new features or components
- When modifying design tokens or styles
- When making architectural decisions

## Location
The specification file is located at: `/spec.md`

## Format
Use markdown formatting consistent with the existing spec structure.
